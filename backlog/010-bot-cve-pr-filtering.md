# 010 - Bot/CVE Basic PR Filtering

## Status
Not Started

## Problem
Routine, low-signal PRs generated by bots (dependency bumps, automated version updates, bulk CVE patch rollups) can pollute profiling/evaluation data and reduce reviewer-simulation quality.

## Vision Alignment
Improves stewardship signal quality by focusing learning and review simulation on meaningful human-review patterns.

## High-Level Scope
- Add configurable filters to detect and ignore low-signal bot/CVE basic PRs in ingest and optional replay flows.
- Support signals such as:
  - Author/login patterns (e.g., bots)
  - PR title/body patterns (`CVE-`, dependency bump templates, renovate/dependabot conventions)
  - Label-based hints (security/dependencies/automation labels)
- Preserve traceability by recording skip reason and counts.

## Out of Scope
- Ignoring all security PRs by default.
- Deep semantic classification of every PR intent.

## Deliverables
- Filter policy config section (enabled by default with safe heuristics).
- Reusable PR classification helper.
- Ingest/replay integration with skip accounting.
- Documentation for override/allowlist behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Matching low-signal bot/CVE basic PRs are skipped when policy is enabled.
- Skip reasons are visible in run summary metrics.
- Policy can be tuned/disabled by config for repos where these PRs are important.
- Existing behavior is preserved when filter is disabled.

## Dependencies
- None

## Suggested Implementation Plan
- Define conservative default heuristics and configuration model.
- Implement classifier + integration in ingest path first.
- Add replay path integration and summary reporting.
- Add allowlist and explicit override options.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for classifier rules and false-positive guards.
- Integration tests validating ingest skip behavior and metrics.
- Regression tests with policy disabled.
